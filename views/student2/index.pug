            |This major is offered at the elusive Serapeum University at the base of the 
            span(class= "golden") Golden Pyramids 
            | in Egypt. Located on the banks of the luminous Nile, 
            | where the waters shimmer with ancient magic, students find themselves immersed in the rich tapestry of history and legend.
            | From secret underground archives to sunlit courtyards echoing with chants of the past, 
            | the campus itself is a living, breathing artifact of ancient Egyptian grandeur.
